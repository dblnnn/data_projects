# Data Projects

Welcome to the Data Projects directory! This repository contains a collection of various data analysis projects that I've worked on. Each project is contained in its own directory and includes a README with an overview of the analysis and its goals. The projects are organized by the type of analysis performed. 

Feel free to explore the projects listed below and dive into the details of each analysis.

## Project List

### [Project 1: Marketing Channels Analysis](https://github.com/dblnnn/ya_projects/tree/main/Marketing%20channels%20research)
In this project, I analyzed the performance of various marketing channels to gain insights and make data-driven recommendations for optimizing marketing strategies.

### [Project 2: A/B Test Analysis](https://github.com/dblnnn/data_projects/tree/main/AB%20Test%20Analysis)
In this project, I've selected a new website feature to implement and analyzed the results of an A/B test to determine whether the new feature should be implemented based on the results of the A/B test.

### [Project 3: Bank Churn rate Analysis](https://github.com/dblnnn/data_projects/tree/main/Bank%20Churn)
In this project I've analyzed the churn rate of a bank's clients and identified the portrait of a client who is likely to leave the bank as well as a retained client. Also I've formulated recommendations for the bank's products team.

## Each project directory may contain the following files:

1. Readme.md - a brief overview of the analysis and its goals.
2. Jupyter Notebook - a detailed analysis of the data and the results of the analysis.
3. Tableau Dashboard - a visualization of the data and the results of the analysis __(if needed)__
4. Python script - a script to collect data / prepare data for analysis / automate the analysis __(if needed)__
