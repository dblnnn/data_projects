# Data Projects

Welcome to the Data Projects directory! This repository contains a collection of various data analysis projects that I've worked on. Each project is contained in its own directory and includes a README with an overview of the analysis and its goals. The projects are organized by the type of analysis performed. 

Feel free to explore the projects listed below and dive into the details of each analysis.

## Project List

### [Project 1: Marketing Channels Analysis](https://github.com/dblnnn/ya_projects/tree/main/Marketing%20channels%20research)

### [Project 2: Sentiment Analysis of musical reviews]()
Currently in the stage of formatting and creating Jupyter Notebook report

## Each project directory may contain the following files:

1. Readme.md - a brief overview of the analysis and its goals.
2. Jupyter Notebook - a detailed analysis of the data and the results of the analysis.
3. Tableau Dashboard - a visualization of the data and the results of the analysis.
4. Python script - a script to collect data / prepare data for analysis / automate the analysis.

If the file is not present, it means that the analysis was not performed or the file is not yet ready.
